The second law of thermodynamics is one of the most interesting "laws" of physics. There are entire books on this topic, and I would love to write such a book someday, but one thing to mention now is that among all of our physical theories, the second law of thermodynamics is thought to be the most likely to withstand the test of time. Almost all of our theories, including classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, special relativity, and general relativity, are either known or suspected to be incomplete in some way, and the expectation is that future scientists will come up with more complete theories that better describe the known emperical data. This is partly because the theories listed above are very complex theories that encompass many equations and attempt to predict a very wide set of phenomena, so it's sort of more difficult for these theories to get everything right. But beyond that, it is also thought that the fundamental premises and foundational assumptions of those five theories are each leading to incomplete explanations of our world. To give a few examples: non-relativistic quantum mechanics does not handle the symmetry between space and time; and general relativity seems incomplete because it gives rise to mathematical singularities that do not seem physical. So these are easily identified issues that can be thought of as fundamental to the foundations of those theories.

The "second law", however, seems different. As far as we can tell, we cannot conceive of any scenario where its fundamental premises are violated. The [wikipedia article on the second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics#Quotations){:target="_blank"} has this nice quote:

>The law that entropy always increases holds, I think, the supreme position among the laws of Nature. If someone points out to you that your pet theory of the universe is in disagreement with Maxwell's equations – then so much the worse for Maxwell's equations. If it is found to be contradicted by observation – well, these experimentalists do bungle things sometimes. But if your theory is found to be against the second law of thermodynamics I can give you no hope; there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation.
— Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington, The Nature of the Physical World (1927)

One might say that this is due to the way the second law is constructed: it is a negative statement, stating that certain things are impossible. Therefore, one could argue that the only way such a "negative" law could have become an established physical theory is that all known emperical evidence supports this; and therefore what we have done is to distill all known emperical data into a succinct summary that is, by definition because we have elevated it to a "law", fully consistent with all the data. So it's all a bit circular.

However, the second law is actually far more than a succinct summary of data. It is in fact a very deep and profound statement about the way that our universe works and it leads to many surprising consequences. Let's consider one such surprising consequence.
