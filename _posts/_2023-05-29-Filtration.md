I started to learn about stochastic calculus because I think many of the most interesting breakthroughs these days, e.g., diffusion probabilistic models for generative AI, involve stochastic processes. Much of the math here is unfamiliar to me with my traditional physics background, and it's been fun and also very confusing learning about Lebesgue integrals, measure theory, sigma algebras and Borel sets, rigorous probability theory, etc. For example, even though I thought I knew what random variables are, learning the rigorous definition of random variables has really changed how I think about them.

As I started down this journey, I quickly came across a really interesting sounding concept: **martingales**. Just trying to understand the definition of a martingale was very confusing for me!

A discrete-time martingale $$X_n$$ is commonly define as follows:

$$


One 

for a field (also called sigma-algebras by mathematicians) that's part of a filtration, what do we mean when we say that it represents our knowledge at that time?

if a field is generated by a random variable at time $$t$$, and the field is part of a filtration, does that field contain information on other random variables at time $$t$$?

In other words, is a given field only generated by one specific random variable?
