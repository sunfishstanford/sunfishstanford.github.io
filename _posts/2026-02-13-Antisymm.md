The antisymmetry operator is a sum of terms, where each term is of the form:
$$
\text{sgn}(\pi)\omega_{a_{\pi(1)},a_{\pi(2)},a_{\pi(3)},a_{\pi(4)},a_{\pi(5)}}
$$

Suppose we arbitrarily pick $\pi := \pi_0,$ a specific permutation.

Define $\phi = \pi_0 (1 2)$

$$
\begin{aligned}

\text{sgn}(\phi) &= - \text{sgn}(\pi_0) \\

\omega_{a_{\pi_0(1)},a_{\pi_0(2)},a_{\pi_0(3)},a_{\pi_0(4)},a_{\pi_0(5)}} &= \omega_{a_{\phi(2)},a_{\phi(1)},a_{\phi(3)},a_{\phi(4)},a_{\phi(5)}} \\

-\text{sgn}(\pi_0)\omega_{a_{\pi_0(1)},a_{\pi_0(2)},a_{\pi_0(3)},a_{\pi_0(4)},a_{\pi_0(5)}} &= \text{sgn}(\phi)\omega_{a_{\phi(2)},a_{\phi(1)},a_{\phi(3)},a_{\phi(4)},a_{\phi(5)}} 

\end{aligned}

$$

The right side of the last line corresponds to applying a (12) permutation operator to the tensor (exchanging the indices in the 1st and 2nd slots). And we see that such a term corresponds exactly to another term in the original sum, but with a minus sign.

As $\pi_0$ runs through all possible permutations, $\phi=\pi_0 (12)$ also runs through all possible permutations.

Therefore applying a (12) permutation operator to the antisymmetry operator multiplies it by $-1$. And this generalizes to applying any odd permutation. Therefore the antisymmetry operator indeed yields an antisymmetric tensor when applied to an arbitrary tensor.
