It's interesting to view chemistry and biology through the lens of software and APIs. [Wikipedia defines an application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API){:target="_blank"} as a way for software programs to communicate with each other via well defined rules (protocols), so that a service provider, whose API is being called, can provide a service while hiding the details of the implementation so that the service consumers don't need to worry about those details. This enhances modularity and composability of a software system and also enables decentralizated architectures.

At a low level, certain chemical functional groups can be viewed as a type of API because we see the same functions being leveraged by many processes. For example, a phosphate group
