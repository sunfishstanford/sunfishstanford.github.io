It's interesting to view chemistry and biology through the lens of software and APIs. [Wikipedia defines an application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API){:target="_blank"} as a way for software programs to communicate with each other via well defined rules (protocols), so that a service provider, whose API is being called, can provide a service while hiding the details of the implementation so that the service consumers don't need to worry about those details. This enhances modularity and composability of a software system and also enables decentralizated architectures.

Similar principles apply to chemistry and biology!

At a low level, certain chemical functional groups can be viewed as a type of API because we see the same functions being leveraged by many processes that may have evolved independently. A great example is a phosphate group, a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms:

![Phosphate group](/assets/images/phosphate.png){: width="100" .center-image }

The bond between the phosphorus atom and the oxygen atom is:
1. Strong enough to be stable (e.g., the phosphodiester bonds in DNA can last a lifetime); but 
2. Not overly strong, making it energetically favorable to break the bond to replace with a stronger configuration and thus release energy (e.g, hydrolysis of ATP). 

Property #1 means that the phosphate group can act as a connector that snaps together lego bricks, and we see that in action within the backbones of DNA and RNA.
